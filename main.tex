\section{Introduction}
The large asymmetry of the distributions of $\bar{d}$ and $\bar{u}$ in the proton was first observed in deep inelastic
scattering experiments via the violation of the Gottfried sum rule~\cite{amaudruz1991}.
The Bjorken-$x$ dependence of this light sea-quark asymmetry measured the FNAL E866/NuSea
experiment using the Drell-Yan process~\cite{towell2001}.
The small-$x$ region has been measured with high precision by E866,
using an \SI{800}{\GeV} proton beam.
The FNAL E906/SeaQuest experiment, using a new spectrometer~\cite{aidala2019} and a \SI{120}{\GeV}
proton beam, has extended the measurement to higher $x$~\cite{dove2021,dove2023}.
Results on the charmonium production have also been reported recently in Ref.~\cite{leung2024a}.
The SeaQuest data is separated into two sets, each roughly half of the data sample.
The first part covers the data taken between June 2014 and July 2015.
Results from the analysis of the first part of data have been reported in the earlier work~\cite{dove2021,dove2023},
and we have shown that the $\sigma_{pd}/2\sigma_{pp}$ ratio to remain above one.
Therefore suggesting $\bar{d}/\bar{u}$ ratio to remain above unity in the proton,
contrary to the results from E866~\cite{towell2001}.
Several recent global PDF analyses~\cite{cocuzza2021,ball2022a,accardi2023,alekhin2023}
have included these results, in addition to the $W$ boson production data from the STAR collaboration~\cite{adam2021}.
The second set of data covers the remaining period up to July 2016.
In this paper, we report the improved results on the Drell-Yan measurements
by including both sets of data collected by the SeaQuest Experiment at Fermilab.
The data constitute a two-fold increase in the detected muons compared to our previous publications.
Since the trigger
conditions and the detector configuration for the two data sets are not
identical, the analysis was performed separately for each data set.
Results obtained from the two data sets are first compared to verify their
consistency, and then combined for the final results.

\section{The Drell-Yan Process}
\label{sec:drell-yan}
The SeaQuest experiment detects $\mu^+\mu^-$ pairs (dimuons) produced in the interaction of a proton
beam with various targets nuclei. The production of massive dimuon pairs are described by the Drell-Yan
process~\cite{drell1970}. In the Drell-Yan process, the leading order (LO) cross section is given by
\begin{multline}
	\frac{d^2\sigma}{dx_1dx_2}=\frac{4\pi \alpha^2}{9x_1x_2s} \times
	\label{eq:DYCross} \\
	\sum_{i\in u,d,s,\dots} e_i^2 \left[q_i^A\left(x_1\right) \bar q_i^B\left(x_2\right) + \bar q_i^A\left(x_1\right)
		q_i^B\left(x_2\right)\right],
\end{multline}
where $\alpha$ is the fine-structure constant, $e_i$ is the charge of a quark with flavor $i$,
and $q_i^{A,B}\left(x_{1,2}\right)$ are the quark distribution functions in hadrons $A$ and $B$
for quarks carrying a momentum fraction $x_1$ and $x_2$, respectively.
An analogous notation is used for antiquark distribution functions $\bar q_i^{A,B}\left(x_{1,2}\right)$.

The leading order Drell-Yan cross section, expressed in \cref{eq:DYCross},
contains two terms since the annihilation could proceed with the antiquark from either parent hadron.
For most fixed-target experiments, including SeaQuest,
the spectrometers have large acceptance for the positive $x_F$  region $\left(x_F > 0\right)$.
Thus, to a good approximation, the Drell-Yan cross section is dominated by the first term,
corresponding to the annihilation of a beam quark with a target antiquark.
With the assumption that $\sigma^{pd} \approx \sigma^{pp} + \sigma^{pn}$,
which neglects small nuclear effects of the deuteron~\cite{kumano1998,ehlers2014},
and charge symmetry for the parton distributions~\cite{londergan2010} between the proton and the neutron,
\cref{eq:DYCross} can be approximated as
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\sigma^{pd}}{2\sigma^{pp}} \approx
	\frac{1}{2} \frac{4+\frac{d\left(x_1\right)}{u\left(x_1\right)}}{4+\frac{d\left(x_1\right)}{u\left(x_1\right)}\frac{\bar d\left(x_2\right)}{\bar u\left(x_2\right)}}
	\left[1+\frac{\bar d\left(x_2\right)}{\bar u\left(x_2\right)}\right].
	\label{eq:crRatio}
\end{equation}

While \cref{eq:crRatio} illustrates the power of the $\sigma^{pd}/2\sigma^{pp}$ Drell-Yan cross section
ratio to reveal the flavor asymmetry between $\bar d$ and $\bar u$,
the actual extraction of the $\bar d\left(x\right) / \bar u\left(x\right)$ ratios
from the measured $\sigma^{pd}/ 2 \sigma^{pp}$ Drell-Yan cross section ratios is
made without these simplifying approximations and is carried out in Next-to-Leading Order (NLO)
in the strong coupling constant, $\alpha_s$. 

\section{The SeaQuest Experiment}
\label{sec:seaquest_spectrometer}
The SeaQuest spectrometer is  discussed in detail in Ref.~\cite{aidala2019},
The SeaQuest experiment receives the  proton beam from the Fermilab Main Injector at \SI{120}{\GeV}
once every minute in 4-second periods (spills), with average intensity of \num{6e12} per spill.
The target system consists of two liquid targets (hydrogen and deuterium),
three solid targets (iron, carbon and tungsten), and two calibration targets (``empty flask'' and ``no target'').
A solid iron magnet focuses the high mass dimuons into the spectrometer.
The spectrometer consists of four tracking stations, with an open air magnet between station~1 and~2.
Each tracking station consists of hodoscope planes, which provide fast signals for triggering,
and drift chambers or proportional tubes, which provide precise hit information for tracking.

The SeaQuest trigger uses discriminated signals from the hodoscope counters.
The main physics trigger requires a coincidence of two opposite sign muons,
one in the top and one in the bottom halves of the spectrometer.
A separate trigger only requires one muon track, and it is mainly used for studying the accidental background.

\section{Data Analysis}
\label{sec:analysis}
Detail discussion on the analysis procedure can be found in earlier publication~\cite{dove2021,dove2023}.
The muon tracks are reconstructed using the hits in the drift chambers and proportional tubes in each stations.
After identifying potential hits originating from interactions within the target region,
the Kalman filter algorithm~\cite{kalman1960} are used to reconstruct the muon tracks,
and determine the best estimate of the muon momentum.
The magnetic field of the two magnets and the energy loss in the solid iron FMag are also taken into account during this stage.
Pairs of opposite charged muons tracks from the top and bottom sections of the spectrometer are
matched to determine the interaction vertex using Kalman filter.

To compare the experimental results with theoretical expectations,
a GEANT4~\cite{agostinelli2003,allison2006,allison2016} based Monte Carlo simulations has been developed.
The Drell-Yan event generator is produce a uniform distribution in mass and $x_F$,
with weights proportional to the theoretical cross section, calculated using CT14 PDFs~\cite{hou2018}.
The dimuon transverse momentum distribution has been tunned to match the measured distribution.
Other PDFs, such as the statistical model~\cite{soffer2019}, were used to measure the systematic effects due to input PDFs.
The efficiency and the resolution of the chambers are taken into account in the simulation
by dropping a small number of hits, and applying Gaussian smearing to the drift distance of the remaining hits.
Both the efficiency and the width of the smearing are taken from the data.
An embedding procedure has also been developed to simulate the background hits by embedding each Monte Carlo events
with hits recorded by the random trigger.

The mass spectrum, as shown in \cref{fig:massfit} can be expressed as a linear combination of different components,
namely Drell-Yan, charmonium decays, accidental background and background from instruments.
These different contributions would have distinct mass spectra, for example, the $J/\psi$
and $\psi\left(2S\right)$ decays would have sharp distributions centered around their masses.
Therefore, the data can be fitted to various templates to obtain
the relative contribution from each sources.
As input parameters to the fit, the mass distributions for $J/\psi$, $\psi\left(2S\right)$
and the Drell-Yan are obtained from studying the Monte Carlo simulation. %, as discussed in \cref{subsec:MC}.
The distribution of accidental coincidence events was made by pairing at random $\mu^+$ and $\mu^-$ collected with the ``single-muon'' trigger
under the condition that the beam intensities of $\mu^+$ and $\mu^-$ events were comparable.
The magnitudes of these components,
with the exception of the empty-flask data for which the normalization is known,
were varied in the fit to the mass spectrum.
The statistical uncertainties of the Monte Carlo and empty-flask date are taken into account using the algorithm described in Ref.~\cite{barlow1993}.
\Cref{fig:massfit} shows the fit to the $p+p$ dimuon spectrum,
and the mass distribution is well described by this fitting procedure.
\begin{figure}[htbp!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{massfit_run56_LH2.pdf}
	\caption{Dimuon mass distribution for events collected
		on liquid hydrogen targets for the second data set.
		The data points (solid squares) are compared with a fit (solid blue line) consisting of
		various components (see text).}
	\label{fig:massfit}
\end{figure}

After the mass fit is performed, and the normalization for accidental background has been determined,
a mass cut ($M>\SI{4.5}{\GeV}$) is applied to remove the $J/\psi$ and $\psi\left(2S\right)$ events.
The accidental background and empty-flask contributions are then subtracted from the data.
The remaining events are projected into various kinematic variables, such as $x_1$, $x_2$, $x_F$, and $P_T$.
Several corrections are applied to extract the final Drell-Yan yields.
These include the effective luminosity, obtained from the total number of protons on targets passing the BIM cut.
A target contamination correction is also applied to the \ce{D_2} data due to \ce{H} contamination in the target cell.
It should be noted that during this analysis,
a revised correction is used as compared with the earlier work~\cite{dove2021,dove2023},
resulting in a roughly \SI{2}{\percent} shift in the measured ratios extracted from the first dataset.
The reconstruction inefficiency and DAQ deadtime, which have a small but non-negligible target dependence,
are also taken into account.


\section{Measurement of The \texorpdfstring{$\sigma_{pd}/2\sigma_{pp}$}{pd/2pp} Drell-Yan Cross Section Ratio}
\label{sec:csr}
\Cref{fig:xT_csr} shows the measured $\sigma_{pd}/2\sigma_{pp}$ cross section ratio from the comparisons
of the two datasets from SeaQuest, and the combined analysis is also compared with
NLO calculations using DYNNLO~\cite{catani2007,catani2009},
with nucleon PDFs CT18~\cite{hou2021} and NNPDF4.0~\cite{ball2022a}.
The measured ratio is also tabulated in \cref{tab:dbarubar}.
The results from both data sets are mostly consistent with each other, except for the low $x_2$ bin where our acceptance is smaller,
and most sensitive to the trigger condition.
The results from the combined analysis strongly suggest the $\bar{d}/\bar{u}$ ratio to remain above unity at large $x$.

	\todo{which PDFs to use?}
\end{figure}

The sources of systematic uncertainties are tabulated in \cref{tab:sys_csr}.
The main uncertainties originate from the modeling of the accidental background ($\delta_{mix}$).
Different methods for generating the accidental background distributions have been studied~\cite{pate2023},
and the differences are quoted as the systematic uncertainty.
Other sources of systematic uncertainties include the the efficiency corrections ($\delta_{Eff.\,stat.}$ and $\delta_{Eff.\,param.}$),
empty flask normalization ($\delta_{Empty}$), and the relative beam luminosity ($\delta_{Beam\,norm.}$).

\section{Extraction of \texorpdfstring{$\bar{d}\left(x\right)/\bar{u}\left(x\right)$}{dbar(x)/ubar(x)}
  and \texorpdfstring{$\bar{d}\left(x\right)-\bar{u}\left(x\right)$}{dbar(x)-ubar(x)}}
\label{sec:extraction}
In order to compare the results from SeaQuest with predictions from various models,
an estimate for the $\bar{d}/\bar{u}$ ratio is extracted from the cross section ratio by
an iterative method, as described in Ref.~\cite{dove2021}.
We first make an estimate for the $\bar{d}/\bar{u}$ ratio over the measured $x_2$
and calculate the cross section ratio $R$ using a chosen PDF set.
This PDF set provides all other parton distributions except for the $\bar{d}/\bar{u}$ ratio,
which is allowed to vary.
The $\bar{d}/\bar{u}$ ratio outside the measured $x_T$ range was assumed to be $1.0$,
and changed to $0.5$ and $2.0$ to estimate the systematic uncertainty arises from this assumption.
The cross section ratio $R$ is then calculated up to next-to-leading order, as
\begin{equation}
	R_{\mathrm{pred}}\left(x_T\right)  = \frac{\sum_{x_1} A\left(x_1, x_2\right)\sigma^{pd}_{NLO}\left(x_1, x_2\right)}{2\sum_{x_1} A\left(x_1, x_2\right)\sigma^{pp}_{NLO}\left(x_1, x_2\right)},
\end{equation}
where $A\left(x_1,x_2\right)$ is the acceptance for a $\left(x_1, x_2\right)$ bin.
The $\bar{d}/\bar{u}$ ratio is then adjusted according to the difference between
the measured and predicted ratios, until the difference is less than $10^{-3}$.

The extracted $\bar{d}/\bar{u}$ from the measured SeaQuest cross section ratio,
using the CT18 PDFs as the basis, are shown in \cref{fig:e906_e866_dbarubar}
and tabulated in \cref{tab:dbarubar}.
While the SeaQuest results are consistent with previous E866 results~\cite{towell2001} at low $x$,
the extracted $\bar{d}/\bar{u}$ ratios from the SeaQuest measurement continue to rise as $x$ increases,
and is in tension with the E866 result.
The SeaQuest results are also in much better agreement with predictions from meson cloud model~\cite{alberg2022}
and statistical model~\cite{soffer2019}.
The extracted $\bar{d}/\bar{u}$ ratios are also compared with results from CT18~\cite{hou2021} and NNPDF4.0~\cite{ball2022a}
global analyses in \cref{fig:e906_e866_dbarubar}.
The inclusion of the SeaQuest result from Run 2-3 in the NNPDF4.0 analysis strongly constrains the $\bar{d}/\bar{u}$ ratios
to remain above unity at large $x$.
With the reduced statistical uncertainties from the combined analysis presented in this paper,
the uncertainty on the $\bar{d}/\bar{u}$ in these global analyses can be further reduced.

		SeaQuest compared with CT18, NNPDF4.0 PDFs as well as meson cloud and statistical models.}

	\end{adjustbox}
\end{table*}

The isovector PDF $\bar{d}-\bar{u}$ over the region $0.13<x<0.45$
can also be calculated from the extracted $\bar{d}/\bar{u}$ ratio by taking the $\bar{d}+\bar{u}$
distribution from CT18.
As a flavor non-singlet quantity, the integral, $\int^1_0 \left[\bar{d}\left(x\right) - \bar{u}\left(x\right)\right] \dd{x}$,
is expected to be independent of $Q^2$, even though the $x$ dependence might differ at different $Q^2$.
As the perturbative processes should not produce a significant $\bar{d},\,\bar{u}$ difference,
the $\bar{d}-\bar{u}$ values can provide a direct measure on the non-perturbative contributions.
The values of $\bar{d}-\bar{u}$ derived from the SeaQuest data are also shown in \cref{fig:e906_e866_dbarubar} and tabulated in \cref{tab:dbarubar},
and are compared with results from E866~\cite{towell2001} and HERMES~\cite{ackerstaff1998},
and with predictions from meson cloud and statistical models.
Unlike $\bar{d}/\bar{u}$ ratio, the difference $\bar{d}-\bar{u}$ is insensitive to the flavor-symmetric contributions
to the sea-quark distributions in these models. Like the ratio, the deduced difference $\bar{d}-\bar{u}$ is also
in good agreement with both models.
It is also worth pointing out that the small $x$ behavior of the $\bar{d}-\bar{u}$ can be studied using
semi-inclusive DIS as indicated by the HERMES measurements~\cite{ackerstaff1998}.
With the advent of the Electron Ion Collider, the flavor asymmetry at small $x$ region, where abundant sea-quarks reside,
can be further constrained.

The SeaQuest data can also be used to calculate two integral: $\int^{0.45}_{0.13} \left[\bar{d}\left(x\right) - \bar{u}\left(x\right) \right]\dd{x}$,
which describes the integrated sea-quark flavor asymmetry, and $\int^{0.45}_{0.13} x\left[\bar{d}\left(x\right) - \bar{u}\left(x\right) \right]\dd{x}$,
which represents the difference in the momentum fractions carried by $\bar{u}$ and $\bar{d}$ quarks.
These values are listed in \cref{tab:dbarMubar}, and are compared with different PDFs and models.
The SeaQuest results are naturally in good agreement with NNPDF4.0 and are in good agreements with the model predictions.
It should be noted that as SeaQuest is only probing the large $x$ region, the sea-quark PDFs are small in this region.
Hence, when compared with the measured $\int^{1}_{0} \left[\bar{d}\left(x\right) - \bar{u}\left(x\right) \right]\dd{x}=0.118\pm 0.012$
from E866 based on the measurements over $0.015<x<0.35$ and extrapolations~\cite{towell2001},
the result from SeaQuest is inherently smaller.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:Conclusions}
In summary, we have reported the improved results on the $\sigma_{pd}/2\sigma_{pp}$ Drell-Yen cross section ratio up to $x_2=0.45$,
based on the analysis of the entire SeaQuest dataset, which supersede the earlier results in Ref.~\cite{dove2021,dove2023}.
The measured ratio remains above unity, which suggests the $\bar{d}/\bar{u}$ ratio continues to increase at large $x$.
The improved statistical precision presented in this paper will help to further constrain the light sea-quark asymmetry in future global analysis.
These results are also in better agreement with various model predictions, including the meson cloud model and the statistical model.
With recent developments in the lattice calculations within the framework of large momentum effective theory~\cite{constantinou2021},
these results can provide an important benchmark for the lattice calculations in the future.
