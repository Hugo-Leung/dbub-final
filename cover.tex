    \opening{Dear Editors:}
    We are submitting a manuscript entitled "Final SeaQuest results on the flavor asymmetry of the proton
    light-quark sea with proton-induced Drell-Yan process" for consideration by Physical Review Letters.

    We report the final SeaQuest measurements of the Drell-Yan $\sigma_{pd}/2\sigma_{pp}$ cross section ratio,
    based on the full dataset. Compared with our previous publications,
    the combined dataset yields roughly twice the number of detected muons.
    We find that the Drell-Yan $\sigma_{pd}/2\sigma_{pp}$ ratio is consistently above unity,
    and that the $\bar{d}(x)/\bar{u}(x)$ ratio increases with $x$ over the range $0.13<x<0.45$.
    These results reinforce earlier indications of an excess of $\bar d$ over $\bar u$ and
    are in good agreement with several theoretical models, including  statistical and meson-cloud models.

    This work will be of interest to a broad audience. 
    In particular, it provides important constraints for global parton-distribution-function (PDF) analyses,
    since it is likely to be the only measurement that constrains the light sea-quark flavor asymmetry at large $x$
    in the foreseeable future. The previously published SeaQuest results reduced uncertainties on the flavor asymmetry;
    the final results reported here will further constrain antiquark distributions in future global analyses.
    Improved knowledge of the nucleon partonic structure at large $x$ is also important for searches for
    beyond-the-Standard-Model (BSM) physics at the LHC, because PDFs enter many theoretical predictions.
    With recent developments in lattice QCD using large-momentum effective theory,
    these results will provide a valuable benchmark for future lattice calculations.

Justification paragraph (no more than 100 words)\\~\\
This paper reports the final SeaQuest measurements of the Drell-Yan $\sigma_{pd}/2\sigma_{pp}$
cross-section ratio and shows that the $\bar{d}(x)/\bar{u}(x)$ ratio increases with $x$ in $0.13< x<0.45$,
reinforcing earlier indications of a $\bar{d}$ excess.
The result provides crucial constraints for global PDF analyses — likely the only measurement probing the
light sea-quark asymmetry at large $x$ in the near term — and improves knowledge of nucleon structure 
used in many LHC predictions. It will also serve as a benchmark for future lattice-QCD calculations.
